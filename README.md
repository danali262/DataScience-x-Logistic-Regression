# Data Science x Logistic Regression

The aim of that project is to create a classifier that reproduces the behaviour of Hogwards' Sorting Hat.

There are three parts of the project:

1. <strong>Data Analysis</strong>
2. <strong>Data Visualization</strong>
3. <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>

## Installation

Run `make install`

## Data Analysis

In the <strong>Data Analysis</strong> part the aim is to produce a `describe.py` program, which mimics the behaviour of `pandas.DataFrame.describe` method.

> Usage
```python3
describe.py [dataset_path]
```

> Example

// add print screen of result
